# Time Series & Forecasting

I strongly believe in "knowledge increases by sharing", so here are my course material for Time Series & Forecasting. Hope students and instructors in this field find these useful and follow this motto so we all benefit. You can access full lectures in my website http://abolfazlsaghafi.info/

It took me some time to collect and organize the material after teaching the course a number of times. If you are an instructor, feel free to use the material in your course, please don't remove my name and credentials from the slides, you may add yours. For students, dive in and share if you find the stuff useful.

Have fun!
